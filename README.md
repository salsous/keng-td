# Welcome to Keysight network emulation Test Drive.  

## Description
For the next hour, you will explore the power of Keysight test tools to validate modern data center networks in a software world. This Test Drive will include both the free version "Ixia-c" and the commerial version "KENG". This lab introduces the concept of Network Topology Emulation via the Container Lab software.
In this Test Drive, we will run four labs: two using the Ixia-c tool and two using KENG "Keysight Elastic Network Generator".

- Ixia-c/Lab1: IXIA-C + OTGEN CLI + CONTAINER LAB + FRR DUT - Data only
- Ixia-C/Lab2: IXIA-C + SNAPPI + CONTAINER LAB + FRR DUT - Data only

- KENG/Lab1: KENG + OTGEN CLI + CONTAINER LAB + FRR DUT - Data + BGP Protocol
- KENG/Lab2: KENG + SNAPPI + CONTAINER LAB + FRR DUT - Data + BGP Protocol
